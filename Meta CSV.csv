57,even with personal data these companies have a long way to go in terms of giving accurate tailored advertising depending on where you are i knew that fb was after more control more tracking and more data when they started to force users to download the actual app in order to use messenger whereas before you could choose to browse fb and use messenger from your browser even on your mobile devices instead of installing any app im against the you can only use my services via my app stance from any company because i like many people dont like being told what to do there are already enough apps we have to install whether we want it or not depending on where we live thanks to our banks governments and other unavoidable entities as it is when you take into account that not everyone has a high capacity storage phone or tablet when storage becomes an issue folks are going to prioritize installing apps they choose to install on that leftover space they have after installing the bank government and workrelated apps they are using in spite of themselves if a company doesnt give me a choice and wants to force me to install their damn app i might as well move on from using them im not using fb messenger much since they disabled the ability to use it via the web browser for android devices,0.17184492,0.420490196,neutral,negative,0.941537321
58,i suspect meta would be having an easier go at it if they werent descendent from a company that willfully ignored atrocious customer satisfaction relative to competition  facebook was never truly liked by their consumers but it was a free product many people found essential with no reasonable competition  that same company now asking people to invest hundreds of dollars in a cuttingedge vr system is a nearimpossible sell,0.0875,0.515625,neutral,neutral,0.553027868

69,i seriously doubt facebooks ability to pull off turning oculus into the next iphone and horizon into the next windows for a whole host of reasons they at best in my vision could compete with other vr platforms as a games store but the biggest issue is that vr does not provide any added convenience that the iphone doesnt already to do vr you need dedicated space the equipment supplementary technology privacy people dont want to use vr where people can see them and security people dont want to get messed with while in vr all an iphone needs is the phone occasional charging and either internet or cellular connection many steps in phone technology have been to improve ease of use like waterproofing being able to unlock your phone hands free etc all of this on top of the fact that facebook despite the rebrand just isnt hip theyre corporate and cold and their name taints anything they touch their data selling practice is relatively well known and their aesthetic makes them look like theyve never left their polished offices in san francisco for a day of their lives,0.136111111,0.352777778,neutral,neutral,0.660859704

80,i do agree that its a company strategy bold one at that theyre bankrolling the vr sector to eventually reap rewards fb just doesnt seem to have a killer app or even a good use case for their rather expensive technology theyre selling oculus for loss probably and the device itself is fairly affordable but youd need pretty beefy machine to properly use it and the users seem to be going more casual and mobile than ever before,0.187037037,0.692592593,neutral,negative,0.837583005

102,from my experience in performance marketing id disagree on the stategic reasongrowth avenue on why fb is pushing the metaverse their revenue from the advertisers on the platform is made up from impressions x advertiser revenue per impressionbudget inefficiencys and while a metaverse and getting access to more personal data could help them increase the advertiser revenue per impression  potentally sell own digital products it is really the impression amount due to increased engagement time that would grow if facebook could get a successful metaverse in place,0.275,0.475,positive,neutral,0.548310637
